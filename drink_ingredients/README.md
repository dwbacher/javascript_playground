<h1>A Rails API & React Example</h1>

<p>

This was a follow-along example built so I could see the interaction between React as the front-end, and Rails as the back-end.

It uses:
- Rails 5.2 API (RESTful interface)
- Rails ActiveAdmin
- React as the javascript "view" layer
- Postgres as the DB
- Deployed to Heroku @ https://ginger-smoke.herokuapp.com/
